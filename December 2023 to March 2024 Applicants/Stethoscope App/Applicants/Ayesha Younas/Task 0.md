##Task 1: Introduction about myself

Hello MentorsðŸ‘‹. Nice to meet you.<br>

I'm **Ayesha Younas** an Outreachy intern with a strong background in machine learning, computer vision, deep learning specializing in healthcare applications. I recently concluded my Master's research focused on the automated identification and classification of lung nodules, employing state-of-the-art deep learning techniques to facilitate early detection of lung cancer and have achived state-of-the art result by 94% accuracy.

My deep-seated interest in the intersection of healthcare and AI arises from a profound belief in its potential to be a transformative force in saving lives. The ability of technology to augment medical practices and improve patient outcomes is a driving force behind my career choices.<br>


Recently I have  started working with Flutter and I find it amazing as it is easy to learn and it is also cross-platform development.I am very excited contributing to improve Mboalab's digital stethoscope app project.I appreciate and I am very excited to be part of the work Mboalab does for the global community.<br>

Thanks, and I feel I will learn so much from each and everyone of you.
