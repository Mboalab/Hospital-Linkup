### About myself
Well, when it comes to my informal side, I have to admit that I'm a total movie buff. 
I absolutely love Sci-fi movies and i am a big fan of the marvel cinematic universe.
I have watch atleast 98% of all MCU movies, followigng every franchise as soon as they are release.
One of my all-time favorite movie of the marvel cinematic universe is the "Black Panther 1" The story line, the characters, and their accents is a true cinematic masterpiece that never fails to captivate me. 
If you haven't seen it yet, I highly recommend giving it a watch!

I also enjoy photography, public speaking and friend group hangouts 

Thank you for your time, looking forward to getting to know you too better. adi√≥s
