## Self Introduction

My name is **Tamnjong Larry Tabeh**, and I am 23 years old. I currently live in Bamenda, Cameroon. I am an aspiring and emerging software developer with some skills in **Flutter, Dart, PHP, JavaScript, Git, and core Java**. Originally I studied to be an Accountant at University, but my passion for programming led me to spend most of my free time during school taking Udemy courses and teaching myself to code.

I love music, particularly American hip-hop and gospel music. Although I'm not much of a sports person, I enjoy playing table tennis. When I'm at home, if I'm not coding or listening to music, you'll most likely find me helping my two younger brothers with their assignments. And if I'm not engaged in any of those activities, I'm probably working alongside my father on his farm.

I am genuinely excited about this opportunity, and my primary goal is to learn, contribute, and support the community.
