## **Introduction**

Hello everyone! My name is Kudakwashe (kuda) Chris Chipangura and I'm based in Chivhu, Zimbabwe. I'm currently in the middle final semester at Chinhoyi University of Technology and am studying mechatronics engineering.

As a coding enthusiast, I'm always working on hobby projects and learning new skills. I have experience with Angular, Django, Flutter and FastAPI. I enjoy building things from scratch and bringing ideas to life through coding. One of the interesting project that i did, is a mobile app that scans airtime scratch card number using camera.I implemented it flutter and google ml kit text recognition it's called Kwik airtime recharge.

I am dancelhall and reggae music lover . I do enjoy both Jamaican dancehall genre and my local flavour of dancehall music- ZimDancehall.
