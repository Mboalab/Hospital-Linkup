# Mboathoscope Test 

After running the application as detailed in the previous task, I proceded to test Mboathoscope on two devices.

**Testing Device 1 Specifications**

- **Processor:** Octa-core 4x2.3 GHz Cortex-A53
- **RAM:** 4.0 GB
- **Resolution:** 720 x 1600



This is a [Video Demonstration](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1nPKImEQsPGJbRaXp7o00zXQPHfwTaagM/view?usp=sharing) of testing the Mboathoscope project using the device above.


## Feedback

### Positive Feedback

1. **Login page Design** The animation on top of the email and password fields is good and is relevant to the application. As I could not access other app features as detailed below, I was not able to explore more app features.



### Needs Improvement Feedback

1 - I tested the app on Dark mode on the Android Device and the app theme did not change. The splash screen was stil white and the app theme was still on light mode. 

2 - After launching the app and getting navigated to the Login page, I clicked on register in order to create an account. 
Here are some notes on the page.
- The register form has no validation as demonstrated in the video above. there is no limit to the number of characters one can put
 in a field, or validation of correct input on the fields for name and email address.

- The gender field requires text input which is not a good user experience as the user should be allower to choose the gender from i.e a drop down selection box.

- There is also no validation and authentication of the hone nmber and no details provided for the phone number format required.

- For the login button, the Login name is mispelled.

3 - Upon clicking the register button, no action happened and there was no details provided as to why the register action did not happen.

## Final Note

I was therefore unable to test the rest of the application beyond the register and login page. 

I repeated the test on a simulator to verify the results above as shown below.
