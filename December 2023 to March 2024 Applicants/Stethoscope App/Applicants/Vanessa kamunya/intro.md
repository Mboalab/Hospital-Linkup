## Introduction
Hello, I am **Vanessa Kamunya** from Kenya. I am an Mobile developer and I also graduated from university late last year. I work with anything from React Native to Cross-Platform development with Flutter and Native development with Kotlin. However, I enjoy Flutter more because it allows me to work on a single codebase for both IOS and Android, simplifying development for both platforms and publishing consistent apps for both platforms.I am also interested in Machine Learning and have recently started contibuting to the Open-Source Ivy framework.
