## 1. Setting Up

### Github Account Creation
I already had a GitHub account.

### Installing Necessary Tools
- **Git**: Installed Git for version control.
- **Flutter**: Set up Flutter for mobile app development.
- **IDE**: Choosed VS Code as my primary IDE, supplemented with Android Studio for its emulator and other advanced Android tools.

Dart SDK: Necessary for Flutter development.
Android SDK: Installed through Android Studio to test the app on emulators and real devices.

## 2. Cloning the Repository
I forked and cloned the "December 2023 to March 2024 Applicants" and "[Mboathoscope](https://github.com/Mboalab/Outreachy-23-MboaLab)"repositories  to my profile for easier access and tracking.

## 3. Setting Up the Flutter Development Environment for Mboathoscope
After successfully cloning the Mboathoscope repository, I proceeded with installing all the required dependencies for the project

## 4. Resolving Minor Application Issues
Upon setting up the environment, I encountered a few minor issues preventing the application from running smoothly. After successfully addressing these, I was able to launch the application without any hitches. I plan to raise a Pull Request (PR) on the Mboathoscope repository soon to share the fixes I implemented.
