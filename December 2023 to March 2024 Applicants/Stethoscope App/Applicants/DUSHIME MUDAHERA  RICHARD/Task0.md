Hello! My name is Richard Dushime Mudahera. I am deeply passionate about technology and have honed my expertise across multiple tools and platforms such as HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript, Python, Django, Flask, PostgreSQL, MySQL, and Git, among others. Currently, I'm immersing myself in Flutter and Dart, while also expanding my knowledge in machine learning. I'm keenly exploring opportunities in the realm of Data Science.

Fun fact: One of my mottos is "Let's code the thing and Have fun!" Also, a song I've been vibing to lately is "[Like My Father](https://youtu.be/GCWl50HQZIM?si=_PvNh-uWhvkmja08)" by Jax.
