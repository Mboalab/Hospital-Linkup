## Introduction


### Hello there ðŸ˜€


My name is **Carla Ejemeh Inya-Agha**. I am a Flutter Developer from Nigeria, graduated from the department of sociology at Ambrose Alli University, Nigeria. My passion for tech and problem solving has led me to take several courses on coursera, enroll in bootcamps/training programs, and take on volunteer roles and internships to better my skills. My core skills are **Dart, Flutter and JavaScript.**


In addition to Mobile Application Development, I have honed my skills as a Technical Writer. As a Technical Writer, I document my experiences as I navigate the tech space, break down complex Flutter-related concepts and create product documentations for better onboarding user experience. I take Learning and personal development seriously, which is why I applied for this program. It is a privilege to contribute to such an inspiring and innovative course by Mboalab.


When I am not coding, I am either seeing a korean series or reading articles on Medium and Quora. My favorite korean series, so far are "Alchemy of Souls", "Arthdal Chronicles" and "Pandora Box" ðŸ˜‰. That's all for now, looking forward to working with you.
