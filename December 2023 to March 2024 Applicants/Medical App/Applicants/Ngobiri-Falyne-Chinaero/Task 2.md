# Mboacare Application
## problem statement
The inability to get information about a specialized healthcare service need or the inability to get information about a healthcare facility around you is a serious threat to life.
Hospitals globally offer treatment of various diseases, however, information regarding which medical facility treats what, and where it is located is a major challenge to both health personnels and patients themselves. The Mboacare app is birth from the lack of such information in today's age. The app connect hospitals so as to share resources and information as per the services they offer.

## methodology
The approach in bridging the gap between various hospitals and their various healthcare services with users (patients) brings the creation of the Mboacare App.
The Mboacare App Allows users to easily find and connect with medical facilities around the world such that they are able to explore healthcare facilities ranging from regular to specialized services from different parts of the world, compare their services, and make informed decisions thus receiving a global healthcare experience.
The Mboacare App works for every user and every hospital despite their location, allowing Healthcare facilities to register and showcase their services on the platform,Collaborate with other Healthcare facilities, giving them the opportunity to reach a global audience

### User profiles
The Mboacare Apprication has a Signup/Login requirement for Hospital facilities that wish to be registered on the platform. Each hospital must register using an ***Email and a Password***.
Upon Registration and successful Login, a Healthcare facility can then Register itself to the platform, providing information such as;

### Suggestions for the UI/UX

1. I suggest the interface should include an onboarding screen that can serve as a user guide in using the App
2. I suggest that a chatroom section be implemented that can allow doctors from various healthcare facilities to share quality information on health-related issues.
3. The settings page should be improved by adding more content such as User/Healthcare History.
4. I suggest that there should be a Sign/up button for a user who is not a healthcare facility and a dashboard for each user that stores each user's activity such as services searched, Hospital contacted and Location at the time of contact.
5. The buttons at the home screen and the colors of the icons representing the non-current page are a bit faint one may not notice it very fast, I suggest that the colors should be pop up and a background color added to the current menu button.
6. I suggest that the profile section be incorporated into the User dashboard suggested in 4 above.
7. I suggest a dialogue button to answer all technical questions or a database of Frequently asked questions be implemented.
8. I suggest additional password requirements be added for passwords to be accepted.
