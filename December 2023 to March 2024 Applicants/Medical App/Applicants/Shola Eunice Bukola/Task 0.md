# Introduction

My name is Ogunshola Eunice Bukola from Nigeria, Osun state to be precise and I am 22 years old. 


I'm predominantly a mobile app developer with over two years of experience using Flutter(Dart) to bring mobile UI's and ideas to life. Also I am a full stack developer and I use HTML,CSS, JavaScript and Python to deliver practical user friendly web applications to meet the digital needs of clients for businesses and brands. 


I studied Computer engineering in school and that's where my love for programming started, I first started with Website development and swelved into mobile app development two years ago. I recently had to quit my job in Nigeria here because I was underpaid and decided to go into open source but I've had a lot of experience in the tech sector in Nigeria. I've had the opportunity to work with several teams across various sectors and these sectors include the e-commerce sector where I built and released an e-commerce app that helps the user purchase items online and offers an incentive which this same user can still utilise to purchase more items(we call it "Jara" in Nigeria). During my time working as a mobile app developer in the web 3 industry, I took charge of building a web 3 app that provided cross border payment solutions for users in diaspora in form of cryptocurrency and a major feature; the virtual dollar card which bridged a payment gap for Nigerians. I have engaged in a number of freelancing opportunities in both mobile app development and full stack development as well change and edit certain codebase. 

I love music and love watching sitcoms. I guess you could say I have a high sense of humor,also i am at a point in life where I look forward to and love meeting new people as I discovered that having conversations and interacting with people helps to see hings from different perspectives and also understand the cycle and journey of life from all aspects. I'm an Ambivert and my spare time I love trying out different cooking recipes.
