# Getting familiar with the Project

Starting with the Set Up, i already have a github account,and also have Flutter,Git and an IDE(Android studio) installed. However for documentation purposes i am going to be stating the steps invloved in Set Up.

## Set Up
N/B: I am using a windows operating system
- Github: to create a github account navigate to [Github](https://github.com/) and follow the prompts. Make sure to use a very strong password to secure your account.
- Git: Firstly you download git from this website [Git](https://git-scm.com/download/win) and you have to choose according to the bits of your windows device after installing. Once its downloaded. installation comes next and aferwards launch Git Bash.
 
  Second step is to check if its installed by checking the version and the way to do this by typing this in your already launched git bash "$ git --version"
  
  Last step is to to set the Path in your System Variables and its peculiar to your device mine was "C:\Program Files\Git\bin"
- Flutter: to install flutter these are the steps to follow

  First step: Go to URL, https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install/windows and download the latest Flutter SDK. As of April 2019, the version is 1.2.1 and the file is flutter_windows_v1.2.1-stable.zip.

  Step 2 − Unzip the zip archive in a folder, say C:\flutter\

  Step 3 − Update the system path to include flutter bin directory.

  Step 4 − Flutter provides a tool, flutter doctor to check that all the requirement of flutter development is met. It is 'flutter doctor', run this in your command prompt to see if there any issues and what to update.

  Step 6 − Install the latest Android SDK, if reported by flutter doctor

  Step 7 − Install your IDE in my case it is Android Studio, if reported by flutter doctor

  Step 8 − Start an android emulator or connect a real android device to the system.

  Step 9 − Install Flutter and Dart plugin for Android Studio. It provides startup template to create new Flutter application, an option to run and debug Flutter application in the Android studio itself, etc. The way to do this following these steps
  - Open Android Studio.
  - Click File → Settings → Plugins.
  - Select the Flutter plugin and click Install.
  - Click Yes when prompted to install the Dart plugin.
  - Restart Android studio.
