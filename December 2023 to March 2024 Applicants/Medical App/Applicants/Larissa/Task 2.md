## Feedback

### Positive Feedback

1. **Consistent design** elements, including fonts and color schemes, throughout the app.

2. **Flash Screen** is intuitive. It effectively captures the essence of the app.

3. **Hospital Registration Form** is comprehensive and easy to navigate, ensuring a smooth user experience.

4. **Search Feature** delivers accurate results promptly, which is crucial for users looking for a specific hospital.

5. **Filter Feature** enhances the overall usability of the app, making it convenient to narrow down options by medical services offered.


### Needs Improvement Feedback

1 - Based on the documention of the project the platform permits users to easily find and connect with medical facilities around the world. However, there is no option for **users** (ordinary people) to register and use the application. Only **Hospital registration** is available.

2 - I was having issue when I logged in with my Google account. I registered using my Google account. However, I was unable to log in using that same account. Below is the video screen shot demonstrating that.

3 - When I logged in for the first time (as a hospital), I fill the form about the hospital. And after submitting, I will be redirected to the list of the existing facilities. Which is great. However, when I logged in **for the second time**, I will be asked to fill **again** the hospital form. Instead, I **should** be directly redirected to the list of the existing facilities. Below is the video demonstrating that.

4 - To enhance the user experience even more, adding more criteria for the filter is suggested. For example, filter by **public**, **private** etc.


## /!\ ADDITIONAL FEEDBACK

This feedback  is from my **second usage** of the application the **next day**. <br>
During my first test, I **did not notice** the menu icons at the bottom except for the active one.

### Takeaway

The **contrast** of those menu icons needs to be improved to enhance the accessibility  of the application. <br>
Below is the record of my second test.

That is all for now. Thank you.
