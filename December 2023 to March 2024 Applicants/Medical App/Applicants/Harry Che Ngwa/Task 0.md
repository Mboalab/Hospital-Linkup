# Introduction

I'm Harry Ngwa, a Cameroonian Software Developer. I have a bachelor's degree in Software Engineering from The ICT University Yaound√©, Cameroon.

My focus is on Mobile and Web development. I'm open to other branches in software development but those and the ones I constantly find myself in.

I also just love computers and technology in general. I'm fascinated by how fast technology changes the world.

## Experience

I have had a few jobs and worked on about a dozen projects both in Web and Nobile development, and I acquired the following skills:

### Mobile Development

- For mobile development I primarily use Flutter/Dart.
- I have also used Firebase and Cloud Firestore on a couple of projects.

### Web Development

- I use PHP for Backend development, and it is my goto programming language for the Web.
- in terms of databases I have the most experience with MySQL, though I used PostgreSql back in school.
- For frontend development I use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I don't currently use any frontend framework but I'm learning Svelte.

### UI/UX & Graphic Design

- I am proficient in Adobe Illustrator, CorelDRAW and Figma. I have used these tools to create designs like Tracks, Calendars, Book Covers, Invitation cards and more.
