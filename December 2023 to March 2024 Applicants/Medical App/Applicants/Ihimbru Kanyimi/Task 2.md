## Mboacare App Documentation Guide 

### 1. Introduction

- Mboacare is an open source mobile app built and maintained by Mboalab, a biology lab and makerspace found in Yaounde, Cameroon. Operating as a research and applied Center for Open Science and Citizen Science, Mboalab was officially opened in December 2017. 

- The aim of MboaLab is to catalyse sustainable local development and improve peopleâ€™s living conditions through open science.

- The aim of the app Mboacare is to connect various medical facilities globally, enabling them to collaborat effortlesly and improve healthcare outcomes.

### 2. Problem statement

#### * Lack of Connectivity and Collaboration: 

The healthcare industry faces challenges in connecting and collaborating across various medical facilities globally, resulting in inefficiencies and suboptimal patient care. There is a lack of an effective platform that enables seamless collaboration among healthcare professionals and institutions.

### * Fragmented Communication and Missed Opportunities: 
The current disjointed approach to global medical facility connectivity leads to fragmented communication, delays in accessing critical information, and missed opportunities for collaboration. This hinders the ability of healthcare providers to share knowledge, expertise, and resources, ultimately impacting patient outcomes.

#### * Need for Improved Healthcare Outcomes
The absence of a reliable platform for global medical facility connectivity prevents healthcare professionals from efficiently sharing patient data, consulting peers, and coordinating care plans across borders. To address this, there is a need for a solution like the Mboacare app, which aims to connect medical facilities worldwide and facilitate effortless collaboration. By leveraging technology, Mboacare strives to improve healthcare outcomes by enabling healthcare professionals to make informed decisions, access specialized consultations, share best practices, and collectively work towards advancing medical research and innovation.

### 4. Methodology
The development of the Mboacare app follows an agile approach, allowing for iterative development and continuous improvement based on user feedback. The following frameworks and technologies were employed:

- Authentication: Google authentication is implemented within the app, leveraging the Google Sign-In API to provide secure and seamless user authentication.

- Database Management: Firebase Cloud Firestore is chosen as the database management system for the app. It allows for efficient data storage, retrieval, and management, enabling seamless creation, reading, updating, and deletion of data.

- File Storage: Firebase Storage, a cloud-based service, is utilized to store and retrieve user-uploaded content, such as pictures, videos, and files. This ensures safe and reliable storage of user-generated data.

- Email Communication: To facilitate personalized email communication, the third-party API service SendGrid is integrated into the app. It enables the sending of welcome emails for successful user registrations and validation emails for hospitals, enhancing the user experience and ensuring effective communication.
